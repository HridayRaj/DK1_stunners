Problem statement:  NYKS has 623 district offices and 29 state offices across the country. NYKS needs software by which NYKS may take the attendance of the officers working in these districts and States. The Mobile should collect the attendance based on the location of the officer through GPS system / Geo-Location System and voice recognition or the software should collect the attendance based on landline telephone number and voice recognition. We expect you to develop a web based app as a solution. However, it is highly recommended to also have a responsive app which can be opened in mobile view as well.

Execution: We team stunners have developed a software for taking attendance through voice recognition. This web based software which can work in mobile as well will work with GPS system/Geo-location system for its authenticity. It will work for all the officers working in Nehru Yuva Krida Sangathan at different districts and states. The software provide user friendly and easy to understand platform to the user which will make the daily attendance system simple but efficient.                                                  
For admin: The admin will log into the system with unique ID and password. Once admin logged in to the system he will have the privilege to add or delete the user. Admin can add a user through a registration form in his/her dashboard. The required fields include first name, last name, phone, email, password, date of birth, address, pin code, city, state, latitude, longitude. The email and password for each user will be unique.

For user:
Unregistered user- The login page has a button “Register” for a new user. When user click on the button he will be directed to a page which will ask for the unique email ID and password (stored in admin dashboard).One cannot get in with wrong credentials. When ID and password match the user will be directed to another page asking for his voice samples , when user submit it, his location will be matched as stored in admin dashboard If they matched successfully user will be able to mark his attendance.     
Registered user- The login page have the Geo-location button which the registered user has to click. Once the user matches his location with the one stored in admin dashboard, he will be directed to a page where he will need to give voice sample. If the voice is detected, that’s all ! User’s attendance will be marked.
